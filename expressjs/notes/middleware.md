### 🔄 Middleware Execution Order in Express.js

In Express.js, middleware functions are executed in the **order they are defined**. When a request is received, Express processes middleware and route handlers sequentially, following the order in which they were registered in the code.

Here's how Express handles incoming requests:

1. **Middleware and route handlers are registered in the order they appear in the code.**
2. **When a request matches a route, Express executes the associated middleware and route handler.**
3. **If a middleware function sends a response (e.g., using `res.send()`), the request-response cycle ends, and no subsequent middleware or route handlers are executed.**

Therefore, if you define a middleware function *after* your route handlers, it won't be executed for those routes because the response has already been sent.

### 🔍 Your Code Analysis

Let's examine your code:

```javascript
import express from 'express';
const router = express.Router();

const timeLog = (req, res, next) => {
    console.log(`Time ${Date.now()}`);
    next();
};

// Route handlers
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('First Home page');
});

router.get('/about', (req, res) => {
    res.send('About Birds');
});

// Middleware defined after route handlers
router.use(timeLog);

export default router;
```

In this setup, when a request is made to `'/'` or `'/about'`, Express matches the route and executes the corresponding handler, sending a response. Since the response is already sent, the `timeLog` middleware defined afterward is not executed.

### ✅ Correct Approach

To ensure that your middleware is executed for all routes, you should define it *before* your route handlers:

```javascript
import express from 'express';
const router = express.Router();

const timeLog = (req, res, next) => {
    console.log(`Time ${Date.now()}`);
    next();
};

// Middleware defined before route handlers
router.use(timeLog);

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('First Home page');
});

router.get('/about', (req, res) => {
    res.send('About Birds');
});

export default router;
```

With this arrangement, the `timeLog` middleware will be executed for every request to the router, logging the time before the route handler sends a response.

### 📌 Key Takeaways

* **Middleware functions must be defined before the routes they are intended to affect.**
* **Express processes middleware and routes in the order they are registered.**
* **Once a response is sent, the request-response cycle ends, and no further middleware is executed.**
