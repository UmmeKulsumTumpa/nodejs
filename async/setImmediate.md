# Understanding `setImmediate()` in Node.js

When you want to execute a piece of code **asynchronously**, but **as soon as possible**, one option is to use the `setImmediate()` function provided by Node.js:

```js
setImmediate(() => {
  // run something
});
```

Any function passed as the `setImmediate()` argument is a **callback** that's executed in the **next iteration of the event loop**.

---

## How is `setImmediate()` different from other asynchronous patterns?

Letâ€™s compare `setImmediate()` with other timing-related and asynchronous APIs in Node.js:

### 1. `process.nextTick()`

* A function passed to `process.nextTick()` is **executed on the current iteration** of the event loop, **after the current operation ends**.
* This means it will **always execute before** `setTimeout` and `setImmediate`.

### 2. `setTimeout(() => {}, 0)`

* A `setTimeout` with a `0ms` delay is **very similar** to `setImmediate()`.
* The **execution order depends on various factors**, but both are executed in the **next iteration** of the event loop.

### 3. `Promise.then()`

* A `Promise.then()` callback is added to the **microtask queue** (specifically the **promises microtask queue**).
* This makes it behave differently in terms of when it is executed.

## Event Loop Queue Execution Order in Node.js (CommonJS)

1. **`process.nextTick` queue**
2. **Microtask queue** (e.g., from `Promise.then`)
3. **Macrotask queue** (e.g., `setTimeout`, `setImmediate`)

### Example:

```js
const baz = () => console.log('baz');
const foo = () => console.log('foo');
const zoo = () => console.log('zoo');

const start = () => {
  console.log('start');

  setImmediate(baz);

  new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    resolve('bar');
  }).then(resolve => {
    console.log(resolve);
    process.nextTick(zoo);
  });

  process.nextTick(foo);
};

start();
```

### Output (CommonJS):

```
start
foo
bar
zoo
baz
```

**Explanation**:

* `start()` is called first, printing `"start"`.
* `foo()` is added to the `process.nextTick` queue and executed next.
* The resolved `Promise` prints `"bar"` and **adds** `zoo()` to the `process.nextTick` queue.
* `zoo()` is executed before moving on.
* Finally, `baz()` is executed from the macrotask queue via `setImmediate`.

---

## Special Case: ES Modules (`.mjs`)

In ES Modules, the **execution order changes**:

### Output (ESM):

```
start
bar
foo
zoo
baz
```

**Reason**:

* ES Modules are **wrapped as asynchronous operations**.
* The entire script runs as part of the **promises microtask queue**.
* When the `Promise` resolves, its `.then()` is appended to the **microtask queue**, and Node.js **clears the microtask queue completely** before moving to the next queues.
* Therefore, `"bar"` is printed **before** `process.nextTick()` callbacks.

## Summary

| Method               | Queue Type               | Execution Timing                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `process.nextTick()` | `process.nextTick` queue | Immediately after the current operation                |
| `Promise.then()`     | Microtask queue          | After `nextTick`, before macrotasks                    |
| `setTimeout(fn, 0)`  | Macrotask queue          | Next event loop iteration                              |
| `setImmediate()`     | Macrotask queue          | Next event loop iteration (usually after `setTimeout`) |

**Note**: Execution order may differ between CommonJS and ES Module formats.
